Sharebnb is a web application inspired by Airbnb. It utilizes Ruby on Rails, a PostgreSQL database, and React.js with Redux as its frontend architectural framework.

## Features & Implementation

## Future Directions

I plan on continuing work on this project. Below is an outline of the features I plan on implementing.

### Reviews

Reviews are great because you can see how people felt about the home where they previously stayed. I plan on implementing reviews which can be seen on a spot show page.

### User profiles

User profiles are important on Airbnb, with the purpose of viewing each other's information once users are sharing/staying at a home.

### Experiences

Experiences are a newer feature on Airbnb, but it would be a whole new user experience to have experiences as a feature. Experiences are similar to spots, but they are events that users are able to book, instead of homes.

### Wish List

Wish lists would be a collection of a user's favourite homes that they think they may be interested in booking now or in the future.

### Messaging

Messaging between users is an integral feature of Airbnb. It makes bookings a lot more dynamic. Adding a messaging feature would mean that users would be able to send a message to another user.
